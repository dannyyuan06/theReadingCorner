# The Reading Corner Club Web App

This is a monorepo using `npx create-next-app@latest`.

## NEA - Submission - Danny Yuan

To see the original code for the submission of the NEA, go to the `NEA` branch. There will be minimal differences but there will be edits to the current master branch to achieve the rest of my strech Success Criteria.

## Set up & run

Most of the code will be in the `/client/src` directory.

At the root run:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

To start all apps:
```
npm run dev
```

The page will reload if you make edits.

## Testing
